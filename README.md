# CNN-Car-Image-Recognition

## Objective
Building a image classification model which classifies car models from different brands, using a convolutional neural network.

## Data Description
[Stanford car dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-cars-dataset/data) was used, with  16,185 images of cars which include 196 different car models. The dataset is split into 8144/8041 Train and Test set, each set includes jpg files with car image. Additional Excel files are available for trains and test sets, the files contain a table with the names of the images, the coordinates of the rectangle where the car in the image is located and the class number. Last file contains the care name for each class number.
